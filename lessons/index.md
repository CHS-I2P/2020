# Lessons

0. ["Hello, world!"](one/)
  
   In this first lesson students will quickly see how they can manipulate a computer to do whatever they want it to!

1. [Variables & Types](two/)

   In this lesson, you will learn to store information in variables. You will also learn about two types of data: strings, which are sets of characters, and numerical data types.

1. [Lists](#)

   In this lesson, you will learn to store more than one value in a single variable. This by itself is one of the most powerful ideas in programming, and it introduces a number of other central concepts such as loops. If this section ends up making sense to you, you will be able to start writing some interesting programs, and you can be more confident that you will be able to develop overall competence as a programmer.

1. [Functions](#)

   One of the core principles of any programming language is, "Don't Repeat Yourself". If you have an action that should occur many times, you can define that action once and then call that code whenever you need to carry out that action.

   We are already repeating ourselves in our code, so this is a good time to introduce simple functions. Functions mean less work for us as programmers, and effective use of functions results in code that is less error-prone.
   
1. [Conditionals](#)

   By allowing you to respond selectively to different situations and conditions, `if` statements open up whole new possibilities for your programs.
   
   In this lesson, you will learn how to test for certain conditions, and then respond in appropriate ways to those conditions.
   
1. [Loops & Input](#)

   While loops are really useful because they let your program run until a user decides to quit the program. They set up an infinite loop that runs until the user does something to end the loop. This lesson also introduces the first way to get input from your program's users.
   
1. [Basic Terminal Apps](#)

   By this point, you have learned enough Python to start building interactive apps. If you are set on the larger projects such as building a video game, making a visualization, or making a web app, realize that we are not there yet. But, if you would like to start building some simpler apps that run directly in your terminal, check out this lesson.

   Terminal apps are a great way to build the core functionality of a program you are interested in, which can then be extended into a more accessible format.
   
1. [Dictionaries](#)

   Dictionaries allow us to store connected bits of information. For example, you might store a person's name and age together.
   
1. [More Functions](#)

   Earlier we learned the most bare-boned versions of functions. In this lesson, we will learn more general concepts about functions, such as how to use functions to return values, and how to pass different kinds of data structures between functions.
   
1. [Classes](#)

   So far you have learned about Python's core data types: strings, numbers, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. In this lesson, you will learn about the last major data structure, classes. Classes are quite unlike the other data types, in that they are much more flexible.
