# Chapter 1
an Introduction

## Notes

When programmers are learning a new language, we tend to write a one-line program that prints some version of the message *"Hello world!"*. This simple program shows will output text to the console (terminal or command prompt) of your computer.

It looks like this:

```python

print ("...")

```

The three dots (...) between the quotation marks can be whatever you like: letters, words, numbers, etc. `print` is what's known as a function in Python. We'll cover functions much later in the course, but for now just know that functions "do something".

For each print statement I write, another line will be printed to the console of the computer.

## Problems

1. ["Hello, world!"](hello/)

   In this first problem you will write a small program that prints text to the terminal of the computer.
   
1. "A message"

   In this next problem, you'll expand upon the idea from "Hello, world!" and print multiple lines of text to the terminal of the computer.
