# Introduction

When programmers are learning a new language, we tend to write a one-line program that prints some version of the message "Hello world!" this is a simple program that shows whether your computer is properly set up to run Python programs.
```python
print ("Hello, world!")
```
{% next "Try It" %}

## Step 1
In the space to the right, write a print statement (like the one shown above) that outputs the text: Hello, World!
{% spoiler "Hint" %}
```python
print ("Hello, world!")
```
{% endspoiler %}
## Step 2
In the Terminal window type the following: `python hello0.py` and hit Enter. This will run the file from the tab above. You should see the text you entered outputed to the console.
{% spoiler "Hint" %}
```
$ python hello0.py
Hello, world!
$
```
{% endspoiler %}
